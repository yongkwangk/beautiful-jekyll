<p align="justify">Welcome! I received my PhD from the Department of Political Science at the <a href="https://www.uh.edu/class/political-science/" target="_blank">University of Houston</a>, specializing in American politics and quantitative methods. My research agenda is broadly concerned with American political behavior, including political psychology and public opinion. Specifically, my primary interest is political misinformation.
