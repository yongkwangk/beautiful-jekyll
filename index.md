<p align="justify">Welcome! I am a Political Scientist specializing in American politics and quantitative methods. My research agenda is broadly concerned with American political behavior, including political psychology and public opinion. Specifically, my primary interest is the consequences  of political misinformation. I am a VAP in the Department of Political Science at <a href="https://www.bucknell.edu/" target="_blank">Bucknell University</a>, where I teach American Politics. 
  
** I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Political Science at the <a href="https://www.uh.edu/class/political-science/" target="_blank">University of Houston</a>.
